**You must Install Tkinter to run this code***
To run the provided Python code using tkinter for creating a housing data visualization
application, follow these installation steps:
1. Install Python:
● If you haven't installed Python yet, you can download and install it from the
official Python website: Python Downloads. **Make sure to add Python to your
system's PATH during installation**
2. Install Required Packages:
● Open a terminal or command prompt and install the necessary packages using
pip, which is the Python package manager. Run the following command: pip
install numpy pandas matplotlib pillow
○ numpy: For numerical operations in Python.
○ pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
○ matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
○ Pillow: For handling images.
3. Download the Code:
4. Save it in a directory on your computer.
5. Download the Data Files:
● Ensure you have the required data files (Python Data .xlsx, consolidated housing
data.csv, stockImage.jpeg) in the same directory as your Python code file.
6. Run the Application:
7. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python code
is saved, and run the script using the following command: python zillpow_main_new.py
This will launch the housing data visualization application using tkinter!!!
8. Utilize the code with various different numbers and combinations to see results!
● There is a limit range for the range of our input numbers. The price, number of
bedrooms, number of bathrooms must be in a reasonable range to populate
results, otherwise it will give you an error.
● For the first three categories of the plots: input all fields in order to generate the
graph.
● For the last one, Scatter Plot of Zillow Housing List, you are not required to enter
a input.
***** Please note that the code assumes you have the necessary data files in the correct format
and location. Make sure to adjust the file paths in the code if your data files are stored in
different directories*******
